# ReBazz

> Welcome to the Real Bazar.

## The Problem

The covid times have turned out to be a boon for the online marketing stream whereas our "Local Markets" have suffered a lot and found it hard to stay afloat. Managing bank accounts and monetary management for shop owners. The demand and supply trap.

## The Solution

Our solution is to make a data collection of all the local shops. Using Blockchain Powered user-friendly services, we will provide a one-stop online exploring portal. Now, the customer can search his product, based on various categories and can get the details of nearby local businesses that have the product. We also plan to implement a payment system based on Blockchain so that the system is secure for both the consumer and the shopkeeper.
